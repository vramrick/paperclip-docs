# Plugins API

The plugins API is the REST surface behind the Plugin Manager UI and the plugin runtime bridge. It covers installation, lifecycle (enable/disable/upgrade), config, jobs, webhooks, local-folder mounts, dashboard data, and the worker-side bridge calls plugins make back to the host.

For the operator-facing walkthrough see [Administration → Plugins](../../administration/plugins.md). For the authoring SDK see [Reference → Plugins → Plugin SDK](../plugins/sdk.md).

> All routes are mounted under `/api`. Most are instance-admin operations; the company-scoped routes are explicit in the path.

## Registry and discovery

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/plugins` | List installed plugins on this instance. |
| `GET /api/plugins/examples` | List the bundled plugins discovered in the current checkout (reference examples and vendored first-party plugins). See below. |
| `GET /api/plugins/ui-contributions` | Aggregate of UI slots and launchers contributed by enabled plugins. The Paperclip UI consumes this on page load. |
| `GET /api/plugins/tools` | Tools declared by enabled plugins. |
| `POST /api/plugins/tools/execute` | Execute a plugin-declared tool by key. |

### Bundled plugin discovery

`GET /api/plugins/examples` returns the plugins that ship inside the current Paperclip checkout. Rather than a fixed list, the server scans the bundled packages on disk for plugin manifests, so the result reflects whatever your checkout actually contains — the reference example plugins plus any vendored first-party plugins. The result is cached after the first scan.

Each entry has this shape:

```json
{
  "packageName": "@paperclipai/plugin-llm-wiki",
  "pluginKey": "llm-wiki",
  "displayName": "LLM Wiki",
  "description": "…",
  "localPath": "packages/plugins/…",
  "tag": "first-party",
  "experimental": true
}
```

- `tag` is `example` for the reference plugins or `first-party` for vendored real plugins.
- `experimental` is `true` for first-party plugins that aren't production-ready yet; the Plugin Manager renders these with an **Experimental** badge.
- `localPath` is what the install flow points at for an in-checkout install.

## Install and lifecycle

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/plugins/install` | Install a plugin package. |
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId` | Read the installed plugin record. |
| `DELETE /api/plugins/:pluginId` | Uninstall the plugin. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/enable` | Enable the plugin; starts its worker. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/disable` | Disable the plugin; stops its worker and hides UI contributions. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/upgrade` | Run the upgrade flow against the plugin's source. |
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/health` | Read the current health diagnostics reported by the plugin worker. |
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/logs` | Read the plugin's recent worker logs. |

## Config

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/config` | Read the resolved instance config. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/config` | Write a new instance config. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/config/test` | Validate a candidate config without persisting it — invokes the plugin's `validateConfig` RPC. |

## Jobs and webhooks

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/jobs` | List the plugin's declared jobs. |
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/jobs/:jobId/runs` | List recent runs for a job. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/jobs/:jobId/trigger` | Manually trigger a job run. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/webhooks/:endpointKey` | Inbound webhook delivery to the plugin worker's `handleWebhook`. |

## Local folders

Plugins can declare local-folder mounts; the UI and CLI use these endpoints to inspect and configure them per company.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/companies/:companyId/local-folders` | List configured local-folder mounts for the plugin/company pair. |
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/companies/:companyId/local-folders/:folderKey/status` | Status of one mount (configured / problems / listing summary). |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/companies/:companyId/local-folders/:folderKey/validate` | Validate a candidate folder path without persisting. |
| `PUT /api/plugins/:pluginId/companies/:companyId/local-folders/:folderKey` | Persist a folder configuration for that mount. |

## Dashboard

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/dashboard` | Read the dashboard payload the plugin exposes to the UI. |

## Worker bridge

These endpoints back the worker-to-host bridge — the calls a plugin worker makes when it asks the host for data, performs an action, or opens a stream. They are typically consumed by the runtime itself, but they are valid REST endpoints for tests and replay.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/bridge/data` | Resolve a `data` request the worker initiated. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/bridge/action` | Resolve an `action` request the worker initiated. |
| `GET /api/plugins/:pluginId/bridge/stream/:channel` | Open a stream channel from the worker. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/data/:key` | UI-facing entry to read a plugin's registered data feed by key. |
| `POST /api/plugins/:pluginId/actions/:key` | UI-facing entry to invoke a plugin's registered action by key. |

> **Stability.** The plugin runtime ships in alpha. Endpoint shapes here may change between Paperclip releases — pin your plugin and Paperclip versions in lockstep.
