# Cursor Cloud

`cursor_cloud` runs Cursor Cloud Agents through the official Cursor SDK so Paperclip can keep task state while Cursor handles remote code execution. Use it when you want durable remote Cursor agent sessions that survive between Paperclip heartbeats.

---

## When To Use

- You want Paperclip to run Cursor Cloud Agents through the official Cursor SDK.
- You want durable remote Cursor agent sessions across Paperclip heartbeats.
- You want Paperclip to keep task state while Cursor handles remote code execution.

## When Not To Use

- You want local execution on the same machine as Paperclip. Use [Cursor Local](./cursor-local.md).
- You do not have a Cursor API key or a Cursor account that allows cloud agents.
- The work the agent needs to do cannot be expressed as a repository checkout.

## Common Fields

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `repoUrl` | yes | Git repository URL Cursor should open. |
| `repoStartingRef` | no | Starting ref for the repo. |
| `repoPullRequestUrl` | no | Pull request URL to attach the agent to. |
| `runtimeEnvType` | no | `cloud`, `pool`, or `machine`. |
| `runtimeEnvName` | no | Named cloud, pool, or machine target. |
| `workOnCurrentBranch` | no | Continue work on the current branch instead of cutting a new one. |
| `autoCreatePR` | no | Let Cursor auto-create a pull request. |
| `skipReviewerRequest` | no | Suppress the reviewer request on auto-created PRs. |
| `instructionsFilePath` | no | Agent instructions file prepended to the prompt. |
| `promptTemplate` | no | Heartbeat prompt template. |
| `bootstrapPromptTemplate` | no | First-run-only bootstrap prompt template. |
| `model` | no | Cursor model id. Omit to use the account default. |
| `env.CURSOR_API_KEY` | yes | Cursor API key. Use a Paperclip secret reference. |
| `env.*` | no | Additional environment variables injected into the cloud agent shell. |

## Session Persistence

Paperclip reuses the durable Cursor agent across heartbeats when the repo and runtime identity still match. Each Paperclip heartbeat maps to a Cursor run on that durable agent. If the repo URL, starting ref, or runtime environment changes, Paperclip starts a fresh Cursor agent.

---

## Execution Details

- Paperclip drives the agent through the Cursor SDK rather than a local CLI.
- Paperclip injects `PAPERCLIP_*` runtime env vars into the cloud agent shell via the Cursor SDK `cloud envVars` channel.
- Paperclip remains the source of truth for issue and task state. Cursor provides the remote execution surface.
