# Adapters Overview

Adapters connect Paperclip's control plane to the runtime that actually does the work. Use this section when you need to choose an adapter, understand what Paperclip expects from one, or build a new adapter package.

## What An Adapter Does

Every adapter is responsible for the same core jobs:

1. Launch or call the underlying runtime.
2. Pass the agent's company, task, and wake context through.
3. Capture results, session state, and usage metadata.
4. Validate the environment before a run starts.
5. Optionally provide a custom UI transcript parser and skills sync behavior.

> **Note:** Paperclip orchestrates agents. The adapter decides how the runtime starts, how it keeps state, and how its output is interpreted.

## Choose An Adapter

| Use case | Start here |
|---|---|
| Claude Code on your machine | [Claude Local](./claude-local.md) |
| OpenAI Codex CLI on your machine | [Codex Local](./codex-local.md) |
| Gemini CLI on your machine | [Gemini Local](./gemini-local.md) |
| Cursor Agent CLI on your machine | [Cursor Local](./cursor-local.md) |
| OpenCode CLI with provider/model routing | [OpenCode Local](./opencode-local.md) |
| Pi CLI with its built-in tool set | [Pi Local](./pi-local.md) |
| Hermes Agent with persistent memory and 30+ tools | [Hermes Local](./hermes-local.md) |
| OpenClaw over a WebSocket gateway | [OpenClaw Gateway](./openclaw-gateway.md) |
| A custom shell command or script | [Process](./process.md) |
| A webhook or cloud service you control | [HTTP](./http.md) |
| A standalone npm package or local plugin | [External Adapters](./external-adapters.md) |
| Writing a new adapter package from scratch | [Creating an Adapter](./creating-an-adapter.md) |
| Building a custom run-log parser | [Adapter UI Parser Contract](./adapter-ui-parser.md) |

If you are starting from scratch, the most common path is:

1. Pick a local adapter if the agent runs on the same machine as Paperclip.
2. Pick `process` if the runtime is just a command.
3. Pick `http` if the runtime lives behind an API or webhook.
4. Use an external adapter plugin when you want independent versioning and installation.

## Built-In Adapters

These adapters ship with Paperclip and are always available in the host:

| Adapter | Type key | UI availability | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Claude Local](./claude-local.md) | `claude_local` | Selectable (recommended) | Claude Code runs with session persistence, skills sync, and structured transcript parsing. |
| [Codex Local](./codex-local.md) | `codex_local` | Selectable (recommended) | Codex CLI runs with session persistence and managed `CODEX_HOME`. |
| [Gemini Local](./gemini-local.md) | `gemini_local` | Selectable | Gemini CLI runs with resume support and local skills sync. |
| [Cursor Local](./cursor-local.md) | `cursor` | Selectable | Cursor Agent CLI runs with `--resume` session continuity and structured stream output. |
| [OpenCode Local](./opencode-local.md) | `opencode_local` | Selectable | OpenCode CLI runs with provider/model routing and `--session` resume. |
| [Pi Local](./pi-local.md) | `pi_local` | Selectable | Pi CLI runs with its built-in tool set and provider/model routing. |
| [Hermes Local](./hermes-local.md) | `hermes_local` | Selectable | Hermes Agent runs with persistent memory, 30+ tools, 80+ skills, and multi-provider routing. |
| [OpenClaw Gateway](./openclaw-gateway.md) | `openclaw_gateway` | **Coming soon** (use OpenClaw invite flow) | Remote OpenClaw instances reached over the WebSocket gateway protocol. |
| [Process](./process.md) | `process` | **Coming soon** (API / import only) | Shell commands, scripts, and custom local runtimes. |
| [HTTP](./http.md) | `http` | **Coming soon** (API / import only) | Webhook-style invocation into your own service. |

> **Info:** The agent-config adapter-type dropdown currently marks `openclaw_gateway`, `process`, and `http` as **"Coming soon"**. They're fully functional in the runtime — they just can't be picked manually from the UI yet. Configure them via the API or an imported company export until direct UI selection lands.

## External Adapters

External adapters are installed separately and loaded at startup from the adapter plugin store. They behave like built-ins once installed, but they live in their own package and can be versioned independently.

Install them from the Board UI or via `POST /api/adapters/install`.

See:

- [External Adapters](./external-adapters.md)
- [Adapter UI Parser Contract](./adapter-ui-parser.md)
- [Creating an Adapter](./creating-an-adapter.md)

## Common Concepts

| Concept | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `cwd` | The adapter's working directory. Most local adapters require an absolute path. |
| `env` | Environment variables passed into the runtime. Secret refs are preferred for sensitive values. |
| Session state | Lets an adapter resume the same conversation or command state on the next heartbeat. |
| Skills | Adapter-specific logic for making Paperclip skills visible to the runtime. |
| `testEnvironment()` | The adapter's readiness check. The UI uses it before you save or run the adapter. |
| UI parser | Converts stdout into structured transcript entries for the run viewer. |

> **Tip:** If you are unsure which page to read first, start with the adapter that matches the runtime you already use, then open the external or custom adapter docs only if you need to package or extend it.
