# Hire Your First Agent

An agent isn't just "an AI". It's a configuration — a specific role, with a specific AI system powering it, operating under a specific budget, with defined rules for when and how it wakes up and works.

When you hire an agent, you're telling Paperclip: which AI system should run this agent, what role does it play in the company, and what constraints does it operate within. The AI itself (Claude, Codex, etc.) lives outside Paperclip. Paperclip is the management layer above it.

The CEO is always the first agent you create. It has a special role: reading the company goal, proposing a strategy, creating tasks, and delegating work to its reports. Nothing in your company moves until the CEO is running.

## Before you start

You'll need:
- A company already created (see [Create Your First Company](your-first-company.md))
- An API key from Anthropic (for the `claude_local` adapter) or OpenAI (for `codex_local`) — see the [Installation guide](installation.md) for how to get one
- **For `claude_local`:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed on your Mac

1. **Open the Agents page and click "New Agent"**

   In the sidebar, click **Agents**. If this is your first agent, you'll see an empty list with a prompt to create one. Click **New Agent**.

   ![The empty agents list with a New Agent button](../images/agents/agents-list-empty.png)

2. **Set the agent's name**

   Give the agent a name (e.g. "CEO"). If this is your first agent, Paperclip automatically makes it the **CEO**.

   ![The new agent form showing the Name and Role fields filled in for a CEO agent](../images/agents/new-agent-name-role.png)

   The **CEO role** is special: it has no "Reports To" field, because the CEO reports directly to the board — to you. Every other agent you hire later will have a "Reports To" field where you (or the CEO) assigns a manager.

3. **Choose an adapter**

   An adapter tells Paperclip how to run your agent. Click the **Adapter Type** dropdown to see your options.

   ![The adapter type dropdown showing available adapter options](../images/agents/adapter-type-dropdown.png)

   <!-- tabs: Claude Local (Recommended), Codex Local -->

   <!-- tab: Claude Local (Recommended) -->

   **Claude Local** runs a Claude Code agent directly on your Mac. The agent has full access to your filesystem in its working directory, can run terminal commands, write and edit files, and call the Claude API on your behalf.

   This is the most capable and most commonly used adapter for Paperclip agents.

   **Prerequisites:** Claude Code must be installed on your Mac. If you haven't installed it, follow the [Claude Code installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — it's a separate Anthropic product. Come back here once it's installed.

   **Configuration fields:**

   ![The Claude Local adapter configuration form with all fields filled in](../images/agents/claude-local-config-filled.png)

   - **Working directory** — The folder on your Mac where the agent will do its work. This is where files get created, edited, and read. If you're not sure what to use, create a folder called `paperclip-workspace` on your Desktop and paste that path here (e.g. `/Users/yourname/Desktop/paperclip-workspace`).

   - **Model** — Which Claude model powers this agent. `claude-opus-4-6` is the most capable and best for strategic roles like the CEO. `claude-sonnet-4-6` is faster and cheaper, and works well for more routine tasks.

   - **Environment variables** — Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and either paste the key as a plain value or store it as a Paperclip secret. This is how the adapter gets access to Claude.

   - **Test environment** — Use this button to confirm Paperclip can see Claude Code and that your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` binding works before you create the agent.

   > **Tip:** If you're unsure about the working directory, create a new folder called `paperclip-workspace` on your Desktop. Use that path until you decide on a better home for your agents' work.

   <!-- tab: Codex Local -->

   **Codex Local** runs an OpenAI Codex agent directly on your Mac. Like `claude_local`, it has access to your filesystem and can run commands within its working directory — but it's powered by OpenAI's models rather than Anthropic's.

   **Prerequisites:** You'll need the OpenAI Codex CLI installed. Check the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com) for installation instructions.

   **Configuration fields:**

   - **Working directory** — The folder on your Mac where the agent will do its work. Create a folder called `paperclip-workspace` on your Desktop if you don't have a preferred location.

   - **Model** — Which OpenAI model to use. `gpt-5.3-codex` is the default and a sensible starting point for a CEO agent.

   - **Environment variables** — Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` and either paste the key as a plain value or store it as a Paperclip secret.

   - **Test environment** — Use this button to verify the adapter can see your OpenAI key binding before you create the agent.

4. **Configure the heartbeat interval**

   The create form's run policy is deliberately simple: you can decide whether this agent runs on an interval, and how often.

   ![The budget and heartbeat configuration fields for the new agent](../images/agents/budget-and-heartbeat-fields.png)

   For a CEO, once per hour is a reasonable starting cadence. You can make it faster later once the company is active and you have a feel for the cost.

   > **Tip:** Don't set the interval too short early on. Every heartbeat costs money. For a CEO, once per hour is a good starting point. You can increase frequency later once you understand your company's rhythm.

5. **Create the agent**

   Click **Create agent**. Paperclip creates the agent and takes you to the agent detail page. You should see the agent with a status of **idle** — meaning it's configured and ready, but hasn't fired a heartbeat yet.

   ![The agent detail page showing the CEO agent in idle status](../images/agents/agent-detail-idle.png)

   The heartbeat is disabled by default when you first create an agent. You'll enable it in the next guide, once you're ready to let the CEO start working.

6. **Set the budget after creation**

   Budgets are configured after the agent exists. Open the agent's **Budget** tab and set a monthly cap that fits the role.

   > **Warning:** The CEO is typically the most active agent — it runs on every heartbeat and does more complex reasoning than worker agents. Budget it slightly higher than you would a worker. $30–50 per month is a reasonable starting point for a CEO. You can always adjust this later.

   Remember: this agent budget is separate from the company budget. Both apply — if either limit is reached, the agent pauses.

7. **Test the environment again if needed**

   Before enabling the CEO's heartbeat, you can verify that the adapter is configured correctly. On the agent detail page, click **Test environment**.

   Paperclip will attempt to connect to the adapter — in the case of `claude_local`, it will check that Claude Code is installed and accessible, and that the environment variable binding is valid.

   ![The test environment result showing a success state](../images/agents/test-environment-success.png)

   If the test succeeds, you're ready. If it fails:

   ![The test environment result showing a failure with an error message](../images/agents/test-environment-fail.png)

   See the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

**"Test Environment" fails**

The two most common causes:
- The environment variable binding is wrong — double-check that you've set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and that the value itself is correct with no extra spaces.
- Claude Code isn't installed, or isn't at the path Paperclip expects — confirm you can open Claude Code from your Mac independently of Paperclip.

**Agent shows "error" status after its first heartbeat**

Open the **Runs** tab on the agent detail page, then click the most recent run. You'll see a full transcript of what happened. Error messages in the transcript will point to what went wrong.

**Budget immediately shows near 100%**

This usually means the model name is invalid and the API is returning error responses that still count against usage, or the bound API key doesn't have available credits. Verify the model name matches exactly what your AI provider supports, and check your API provider's billing page to confirm your account has credit.
