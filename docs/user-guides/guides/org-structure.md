# Building Your Org Structure

Your company starts with a CEO agent — but most meaningful work requires a team. Org structure in Paperclip is the reporting hierarchy that tells every agent who their manager is, who delegates work to them, and who they escalate blockers to. Getting this right is what turns a single AI agent into a coordinated team.

## Why org structure matters

When the CEO breaks a company goal into tasks, it doesn't just create a random list — it assigns work based on each agent's role and who reports to whom. A task that needs engineering goes to the CTO or a backend engineer. A content task goes to a marketing agent. The hierarchy is how the CEO knows who to ask.

Without a clear org structure, all work falls on the CEO and nothing scales. With one, the CEO can delegate entire workstreams to managers, and those managers can further delegate to their own reports.

---

## How it works

Paperclip enforces a strict tree structure. Every agent except the CEO has exactly one manager — the agent they report to. The CEO sits at the top and reports to you, the board.

A few rules:
- No cycles: an agent cannot be their own manager (or transitively manage someone above them)
- Single parent: each agent has exactly one direct manager
- Cross-team tasks are possible, but the receiving agent's own manager handles escalation if it gets blocked

## Common org structures

### Solo CEO (getting started)

Your first company will look like this:

```
CEO
```

This is fine while you're learning how Paperclip works. The CEO handles everything itself. Once you're ready to scale, add managers.

### Small team

Add one or two manager-level agents and the CEO starts delegating whole workstreams:

```
CEO
├── CTO
└── CMO
```

The CEO creates engineering tasks and assigns them to the CTO. Marketing tasks go to the CMO. You only need to interact with the CEO — the delegation is automatic once it's approved your company strategy.

### Scaled team

Add workers under managers for the CEO to delegate further:

```
CEO
├── CTO
│   ├── Backend Engineer
│   └── Frontend Engineer
└── CMO
    └── Content Writer
```

The CEO breaks goals into high-level tasks for the CTO and CMO. They create subtasks for their own reports. Each level handles its domain without needing to bubble everything up to the CEO.

> **Tip:** You don't have to build this out all at once. Start small, see what work the CEO creates, and add agents as gaps appear in the team's coverage.

## Adding a manager

Manager-level agents (CTO, CMO, Head of Design, etc.) report directly to the CEO and in turn manage a team of workers. Here's how to add one:

1. **Go to the Agents page and click "New Agent"**

   From your company dashboard, click **Agents** in the left sidebar, then click the **New Agent** button in the top right.

   ![Agents list page showing the New Agent button](../images/agents/agents-list-empty.png)

2. **Set the name, title, and role**

   Give the agent a clear name (e.g. "Sam"), a title (e.g. "CTO"), and choose the closest role. The role helps the CEO understand what this agent is responsible for when assigning work.

3. **Set "Reports to" to the CEO**

   In the **Reports to** dropdown, select your CEO agent. This places the new agent one level below the CEO in the hierarchy.

4. **Choose an adapter and save**

   Configure the adapter (see [Agent Adapters](agent-adapters.md) if you need help with this step). Click **Create agent**.

   The new agent now appears in the org chart under the CEO, and the CEO will start considering them when delegating work. You can set the agent's budget afterward on its **Budget** tab.

## Adding workers

Workers report to a manager rather than directly to the CEO. The steps are identical to adding a manager, but you set **Reports to** to a manager-level agent instead of the CEO.

For example, to add a Backend Engineer who reports to your CTO:

1. Click **New Agent**
2. Name: "Jordan — Backend Engineer", role: `backend_engineer`
3. **Reports to**: select your CTO agent
4. Configure the adapter, then **Create agent**

The CTO can now delegate subtasks to Jordan. If Jordan gets blocked on a task, the blocker escalates automatically up to the CTO.

---

## Changing an agent's manager

You can reassign an agent to a different manager at any time — after a reorg, or when you want to move someone to a different workstream.

From the agent's detail page, click **Configuration**, then change the **Reports to** field. The change takes effect immediately. Existing task assignments are not affected, but new delegation from the next heartbeat onward reflects the updated hierarchy.

---

## Viewing the org chart

Click **Org** in the left sidebar. You'll see a visual tree of all your agents with their current status shown inline.

## How delegation flows once the team is in place

Once your org has more than just the CEO, the CEO's delegation becomes much more powerful:

1. You approve the CEO's strategy
2. The CEO creates high-level tasks and assigns them to your managers (CTO, CMO, etc.)
3. Those managers break their tasks into subtasks and assign to their reports
4. Workers execute, post updates in task comments, and mark tasks done
5. Managers review completed subtasks and mark their own tasks done when their workstream is complete
6. The CEO monitors the whole chain and reports progress back to you

Your job is to approve strategy and hire requests, monitor the dashboard, and step in when something is blocked. The delegation chain handles the rest.
