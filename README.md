# Paperclip Docs

Source for the [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) documentation site — user guides, API and CLI reference, adapter docs, and deployment notes.

**Read the docs:** https://aronprins.github.io/paperclip-docs/

## What's inside

- **Guides** — Getting started, core concepts, and day-to-day usage.
- **API reference** — Control-plane endpoints and payload schemas.
- **CLI reference** — `paperclip` command surface.
- **Adapters** — Plugin authoring and the integrations catalogue.
- **Deploy** — Self-hosting, upgrades, and operational guidance.

The site is a single static shell that renders the Markdown files in `docs/` directly — no framework, no build step required to read the raw pages.

## Contributing

Spotted a typo, a broken link, or something that could be clearer? There are two easy paths, both linked from the footer of every docs page:

- **Suggest an edit** — opens the underlying Markdown file in GitHub's web editor. Make the change and submit a PR without leaving the browser.
- **Report an issue** — opens a prefilled [Docs feedback](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/03-docs-feedback.yml) issue with the page URL already attached.

For larger changes, fork the repo and open a PR against `main`. Screenshots live under `docs/user-guides/screenshots/{light,dark}/` and should be provided in both themes when replacing UI captures.
